## RGV Locksport

RGV Locksport is a social group dedicated to the hobby of Locks, Lockpicking, and physical security in general.

We host regular, informal, and easy-going meetups to share the skill and hobby of lock picking.

Founded in January of 2020, we are currently a small group, but are growing.

We are modeled after several other Texas Locksport groups, namely Houston Locksport.

Our founding members have secured a minor corporate sponsorsor who has been generous enough to allow us to use their building in harlingen for larger organized invite-only projects.

Our regular meetups are public and welcome to all who are interested in learning about the art and hobby of lock picking and physical security.

Our regular meetup venue changes occasionally, but we will try to arrange it where we are close to the concentration of members.


### We have a few general rules: 
```markdown
Rule 1: Our meetups are restricted to 18+ adults however teenagers may join with permission and participation of their adult parent. 
Rule 2: If we are meeting at a restrurant or bar, we expect you to handle your alcohol.. Please do not make us ban you.
Rule 3: We absolutely positively NEVER endorse nor tolerate anything illegal, criminal, or any activity that even seems questionable. You *WILL* be banned.
Rule 4: Please respect the property and privacy of other members. 
Rule 5: Please be a respectful mature adult. 
Rule 6: Never pick a lock that you do not own or do not have absolute permission to pick.
Rule 7: Do not pick locks that you rely on... you will eventually damage one.
